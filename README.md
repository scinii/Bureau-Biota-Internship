This code accompanies my Internship report where we studied zooplankton in the Svalbard island.
Below we may find a list of the different R files and what they do

- preprocessing.R: we perform the intial preprocessing on the initial excel file.
- utils.R: all the main functions we reuse in the other files.
- exploratory_analysis.R: where we have the workflow for exploratory analysis
- ordination.R: PCA and RDA on our data.
- spatial.R: Trend-Surface Analysis and the Mantel Correlogram.
- kriging_preprocessing.R: create the excel file for kriging.
- kriging.R: where we have all the functions and workflow for kriging/gaussian processes.
